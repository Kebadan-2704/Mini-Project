Create a file named README.md in your project folder and paste this content:

# 🌿 Mini Project - Plant Disease Classification

This repository contains my **Mini Project** on Plant Disease Detection using Machine Learning.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project classifies plant leaf images into **healthy** or **diseased** categories using deep learning models such as CNNs.

## 🧩 Steps to Run the Project
1. **Download or clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kebadan-2704/Mini-Project.git


Unzip the project (if downloaded as a ZIP).

Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run the notebook file:

Plant Disease Classification.ipynb

📦 Requirements

Install the required dependencies before running the notebook:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is from the PlantVillage dataset, containing multiple plant leaf images (Healthy and Diseased).

🏁 Output

The model predicts the type of disease in the plant leaf image.

Shows accuracy and loss graphs for model evaluation.
